**No way I'm writing any more documentation than this:**

trlol lets you write to the console: you can write letter by letter by writing "troll" the amount of iterations into the alphabet (example: troll troll is b and troll is a)
before you write troll, write hehe to have a capital letter or write hoohoo to write numbers (the numbers are the opposite of the letters because fuck you and the first number is an amongus that renders as a ? in terminal)
also use lol to move onto the next character.

Example: trlol troll lol hehe troll troll lol hoohoo troll troll troll will print "aB8"



woah lets you wait for the user to press anything because its like woah slow down buddy goin too fast yknow



kewlour followed by the spelling (using the trlol logic) of a colour will change the text colour. You can use any of c#'s Console.ConsoleColor's and yes its case sensitive

Example: kewlour hehe troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll troll lol troll troll troll troll troll lol troll troll troll troll turns the colour to red (it spells "Red")



kys tries tp launch a game on steam by spelling the steam app ID using the trlol method
